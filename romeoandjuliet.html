                            The story begins with the Capulets and the Mountages
                            fighting in the plaza, the prince came and was upset
                            by the situation so he ordered peace between the
                            families. If that happened again they will be
                            condemned to death.<br /><br />
                            Romeo was really melancholic because he was in love
                            with Rosaline. His friends decided to take him to
                            the Capulets masked ball. They were not welcome
                            there because they were Mountages, but they went
                            anyways. In there, Romeo fell in love with Juliet, a
                            really beautiful girl daughter of Lord Capulet.
                            After the masked ball, Juliet's mother asked Juliet
                            if she would agree to marry Count Paris, a really
                            rich and powerful man from Verona. In the ball,
                            Tybalt heard Romeo's voice and he realised that he
                            was a Mountage, so he challenged him to a duel the
                            next morning. After the ball, Romeo went to Juliet's
                            room and he kissed her.<br /><br />
                            The next morning, Romeo asked Friar Laurence if he
                            could marry him with Juliet. He agreed after asking
                            how in love were them. Romeo's servant told his
                            friends that Tybalt had challenged him to a duel,
                            but it never happened.<br /><br />
                            Romeo told Juliet's nurse that they were marrying.
                            After the marriage, Romeo fought Tybalt and ended up
                            killing him after Tybalt killed Mercutio. The prince
                            condemned Romeo to death.<br /><br />
                            Juliet was informed that Romeo was exiled and she
                            cried for days. He tried to kilk himself. The
                            Capulets organised Juliet's wedding with Count
                            Paris. Romeo went to Juliet's balcony to say
                            goodbye. Juliet is told that she is going to marry
                            Paris. She goes to Friar Laurcence's and tells him
                            the news and he makes a plan to avoid this wedding
                            and allow Juliet to live her love with Romeo without
                            having to worry about their families hating each
                            other.<br /><br />
                            The plan goes wrong and Romeo and Juliet end up
                            commiting suicide. Because of this, their families
                            finally stopped hating each other.
